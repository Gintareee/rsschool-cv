### **Summary**
*I am a motivated and hard-working individual who is always looking for new challenges. I’m looking to switch into a different career, and I am excited to learn and grow as a developer. Not only do I feel it’s a better industry for future growth and job security, but it's an industry I've always wanted to be a part of. Building easy to use, user-friendly websites and applications is truly passion of mine and I am confident I would be an excellent addition to any organization. I am analytical, I have a keen eye for details and layout aesthetics. Also, I have great problem-solving skills and I work well in a team, which I think is one of the key skills in IT. In addition, I’m curious about new technologies and I am driven to find ways to implement them in my work.*
